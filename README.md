# Angular Elypian Components [![discord-members]][discord] [![gitlab-build]][gitlab] [![gitlab-coverage]][gitlab] [![npm-downloads]][npm] [![donate-shield]][elypia-donate]
## About
This is a small extension to [Material Angular], it is made with the intent to continue using
the Material Angular components and styles while trying to build additional components.  

New components build in this library may or may not be compatible with the original [Material Design] spec

ng-elypian is a small library which only depends on [Material Angular] and provides some
small components but usually neccasary or useful components to get a website started, there are also
directives and validators added for form validation and such as well.  

All components are visible through the [Angular Elypian] website with documentation,
usage, and examples to get you going.
