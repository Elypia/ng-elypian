# Elypian Angular
## About
This is a small extension to [Material Angular][mat-ang], it is made with the intent to continue using the Material Angular components and styles while trying to build additional components for use across internal projects.  

In future it would be wonderful to try put some of the components in this library into a pull-request for Material Angular if any are worth putting forward but at present this component library or "extension" will be the package that makes it easy to manage components until then.
