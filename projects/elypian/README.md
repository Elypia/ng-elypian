## About
This is a small extension to [Material Angular][mat-ang], it is made with the intent to continue using
the Material Angular components and styles while trying to build additional components.  
ng-elypian is a small library which only depends on [Material Angular][mat-ang] and provides some
small components but usually neccasary or useful components to get a website started, there are also
directives and validators added for form validation and such as well.  

All components are visible through the [ng-elypian][ng-ely] website with documentation,
usage, and examples to get you going.

In future it would be wonderful to try put any viable components in this library into a pull-request
for Material Angular if any are worth putting forward.
