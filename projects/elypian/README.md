## About
Angular Elypian Components is a **_very subjective_** library which contains
Angular components that can be used across projects. It is designed with internal
use in mind, however as it's open-source, anyone is welcome to depend on, 
contribute, or review the code for any purpose.

This is an essentially an extension for [Material Angular], as we're keen on using Material Design, 
however, the official library is missing a lot of commonly required components. We're centralizing 
them here so it's easy for anyone to reuse them.

**New components created in the library may not adhere strictly to the [Material Design] spec.**

## Open-Source

## Support

itself then we'll make sure to get it sorted.
